That perfect moment  
That ideal setup on mind  
But you know it’s not easy  
A hard wait is certain.  

Even so, you buckle up for every instant

Hoping it’s your day  
Failures are inevitable  
Every fall, every dip, every slip  
You grow more anxious and ruffled  

Indolence sets in.  

Nevertheless, without all of these  
How will you ever better yourself  

Just so you know, all those wretched portions of you  
Are carved to gold in that suffering  

So fine and pure, you rise again  
Well enough to know, you’re on shore.
