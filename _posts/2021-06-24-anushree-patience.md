That perfect moment\n
That ideal setup on mind\n
But you know it’s not easy\n
A hard wait is certain.\n

Even so, you buckle up for every instant

Hoping it’s your day\n
Failures are inevitable\n
Every fall, every dip, every slip\n
You grow more anxious and ruffled\n

Indolence sets in.\n

Nevertheless, without all of these\n
How will you ever better yourself\n

Just so you know, all those wretched portions of you\n
Are carved to gold in that suffering\n

So fine and pure, you rise again\n
Well enough to know, you’re on shore.\n
