We are the most beautiful people  
Strange mind, yearning heart  
Although we seem to be quiet  
We are the sharpest of the creatures to know-it-all  
  
I look at you, but I don’t easily concede  
Doesn’t mean I hate you,  
It’s just that I already did, in my mind  
Trust me, we are not rude.  
  
We don’t have a lot of friends  
But once I trust you, there’s no looking back  
In case you don’t pull me in,  
Me and the wall painting work in unison  
  
Being cute and quaint at the same time,  
We still persist a subtly vibrant temperament.
